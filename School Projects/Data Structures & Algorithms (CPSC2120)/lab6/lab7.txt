1)         5
         /   \
       3,4   8,9
      /     /   \
    1,2   6,7    10

2)  1, 2, 6, 7, 10

3)  it means that there will only be one copy of MAX throughout all of the objects of that class

4)  gives us the option to define a method in a base class and have a method of the same name and type in a
        derived class when a user calls the base class function

5)  it is used so that another key can be inserted into the given node
    if a nullptr is returned, a key will not be added to a particular node or the node cannot contain
        additional keys

6)  The algorithm checks if the current node can accept any more keys, if so, a new key is added.
        If the node cannot contain any more, it checks that node's sibling to see if it can accept a key.
        If it can, a new key will be added to that sibling. This is done in order until the bottom of
        the tree has been reached.

7)  this method prints out the current depth of the tree, and in this case, the depth is 0 because it is at the root

8)  good: a value can be found without going too far deep into the tree
    bad:  runtime is slow
