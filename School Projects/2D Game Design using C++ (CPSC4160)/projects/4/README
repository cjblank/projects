Project description: Adding a Player Object

The easiest part of this project: The easiest part of the project was implementing the HUD.

Problems that I had in completing this project: I had some trouble figuring out the referencing of 
		observers within the Observer design pattern. 

A few sentences describing my proposed project: My game will consist of a few levels of varying 
		difficulties for the final project that will have the PoliceMan sprite fighting off zombies 
		along with flying monsters that will be dropping objects in the harder difficulties that 
		the PoliceMan will have to dodge. The controls will mainly consist of moving the player to the
		left and to the right as well as giving the player the ability to shoot a gun for shooting the 
		zombies. The game will keep score either by keeping track of the elapsed time the player lasts 
		within a level or by keeping a kill counter of the zombies. Each game will conclude with the 
		death of the player, and that might be acheived by a level up, in terms of difficulty, during 
		the game if the player reaches a certain point total in order to ensure that they would result 
		in a death eventually.
