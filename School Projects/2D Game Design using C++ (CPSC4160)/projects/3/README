Project description: Polymorphism in Action

where did I get my sprites, including background:
  policeman sprites: https://craftpix.net/freebies/2d-game-police-character-free-sprite-sheets/
  zombie sprites: https://craftpix.net/freebies/2d-game-zombie-character-free-sprite-pack-1/
  backgrounds: https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-pixel-art-street-2d-backgrounds/
  flying monster: https://lionheart963.itch.io/free-platformer-assets

What is the theme of my animation: A cop running in a post-apocalyptic world
            with flying monsters flying above him.

Did I make a polymorphic vector:  Yes

What do I like better:  Meyer's Singleton

The easiest part of this project: adding the layers to the world

Problems that I had in completing this project: spawning the flying monsters on within the world
