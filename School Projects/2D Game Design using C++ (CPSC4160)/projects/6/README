Project description: This is the final version of my game. The game is a survival
                        game of sorts where the player has to shoot his way
                        through 5 rounds of zombies. The player has 3 lives per
                        round and has the option to restart at any time.

The Pizzazz feature that I added: I used painter's algorithm for the flying
                                    monsters in order to create the illusion of
                                    depth.
